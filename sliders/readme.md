As of shiny 0.12.1 there is only access to certain parameters of Ion.RangeSlider. Through the wonderful world of [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) and `extendShinyjs()` is possible to access any parameter.

In this super basic example a user can add a list of values to have the slider take.

Demo is on [shinyapps.io](https://alexwhan.shinyapps.io/sliders)
